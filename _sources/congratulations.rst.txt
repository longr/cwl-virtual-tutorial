Congratulations, you and the VM are now ready to take part in the training.
The VM will stay switched on until the end of the training and you can connect to it again using ssh. Please use the VM solely for the purpose of the training exercises.

If you prefer to use a GUI (Graphical User Interface), or are on windows we would suggest that you use the next section, "Using VS Code".

Otherwise we look forward to seeing you at the tutorial.  The tutorial will make heavy use of the `Common Workflow Language User Guide <https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/>`_, https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/ so feel free to browse the guide and try out "Hello World" before the tutorial.
