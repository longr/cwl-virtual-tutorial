Team Membership
=============================

You need permissions to build a VM and in the BioExcel Cloud Portal a concept of *Teams* is used to grant permissions.
In order to build a VM for CWL Training, you need to become a member of a team called: *CWL Training*. 

Requesting team membership
===========================

You will first need to `register with Elixir AAI
<https://elixir-europe.org/register>`_.

Once you have registered, you can check it was successful by logging onto the BioExcel Cloud Portal.

1. Log in to `BioExcel Portal <https://bioexcel.ebi.ac.uk/>`_ as described in the previous chapter.
2. Click your user name in the upper right corner and choose **Profile** from the drop-down menu.
3. Click the **Tab Teams**. If you are a new user to BioExcel Cloud Portal, you should see no teams on the list.

Checking team membership
========================

1. After the team owner adds you to a team (that is manual, so please, give us some time), you will receive an email saying:

   .. code-block:: none
